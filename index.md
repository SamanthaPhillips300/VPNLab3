NOTE: I used a Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) 64 droplet on DigitalOcean for this installation process.

## Step 1: Install Docker

Run the following two commands:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install docker.io
    
Notes: 
The first command updates apt, so it is pulling the latest installs from the apt repository.
The second command installs docker.


## Step 2: Install Docker Compose

First, install curl (if it is not already installed) with the following command:

    sudo apt install curl
  
So, what is curl? Well, I'm glad you asked. Curl is a command line tool to transfer data to or from a server. We will be using it to install Docker Compose from Github. Docker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications.

Next, run the following commands to install docker-compose:

    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    
The first command is transfering the docker-compose data found on the github site, that is shown in the command. The second command is modifying the permissions of the downloaded docker-compose data by making it able to be executed.   

After docker-compose is finished installing, run the following command to check the installation is successful and the version.

    docker-compose â€“version
    
Here is what my result looked like after running the command:
